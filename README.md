## What is OpenEscordia?

OpenEscordia is a free, modular, open-source RPG building tool with AI integrations. It enables developers to create fully-fledged RPG games with ease and flexibility. The core of OpenEscordia revolves around **Modules**, which represent entire RPG games. The OpenEscordia engine loads these modules and instantly prepares them for gameplay.

### Key Features

- **AI Integrations**: Effortlessly create engaging narratives with AI. Automatically generate NPC dialogues, item descriptions, and more to enrich your RPG world.
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality effortlessly with **Plugins**. You can drag and drop existing plugins or create new ones to expand your game's capabilities.
