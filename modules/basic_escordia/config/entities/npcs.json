The cave be riddled with deadly traps and puzzles, and the goblins themselves be cunning and quick. They'll ambush thee with their sneaky tactics and overwhelm thee with sheer numbers. But fear not, brave adventurer! If ye can survive the perils within, the treasure hidden deep within the cave shall be thine for the taking. So, what say ye? Dost thou dare to enter the belly of the beast and claim thy fortune?",

May Fortune smile upon thee, and may thy sword arm remain strong against the foul creatures that dwell within."
